## Prerequisites

Before getting started, you will need the following installed on your local machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (Recommended version: 14.x or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name
````

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install all necessary dependencies using either `npm` or `yarn`:

Using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

Using Yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

### 3. Running the Development Server

To run the app in development mode, execute:

Using npm:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Using Yarn:

```bash
yarn dev
```

The development server will start and the app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### 4. Building for Production

To build the app for production, run the following command:

Using npm:

```bash
npm run build
```

Using Yarn:

```bash
yarn build
```

This command will create an optimized production build in the `dist/` folder.

### 5. Running the Production Server

To preview the production build locally, use the command:

Using npm:

```bash
npm run preview
```

Using Yarn:

```bash
yarn preview
```

This will serve the production build on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

## Scripts

* `npm run dev` / `yarn dev`: Starts the development server.
* `npm run build` / `yarn build`: Creates an optimized production build.
* `npm run preview` / `yarn preview`: Serves the production build for preview.
* `npm run lint` / `yarn lint`: Lints the project files using ESLint.
* `npm run test` / `yarn test`: Runs tests using Jest.

## Technologies Used

* **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* **Vite**: Next-generation, fast development and build tool for modern web projects.
* **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
* **React Router**: Declarative routing for React applications.
* **React Context API**: A simpler way to manage state globally across the app.
* **ESLint**: JavaScript linting tool to maintain code quality.
* **Jest**: JavaScript testing framework for unit and integration tests.
